Players Control:

Player 1: Up - W
          Down - S
          
Player 2: Up - UP Arrow Key
          Down - DOWN Arrow Key

Changes and implementation made:

1) Adjusted the hitbox of the paddle. The ball can now bounce off the full length of the paddle.

2) Paddle movement range is now adjusted to the boundary of the screen. In other words, the paddle can no longer go off screen and will      only move up and down to the edge of the screen.

Ending note:

The speed of the ball differ a bit per user. Make sure to adjust the speed of the ball to fit your desire speed. I had to adjust it slower for my home computer and faster for my laptop.

Thank you for viewing. Enjoy =)
